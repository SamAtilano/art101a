			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode before actually coding. Make a list and break it down into steps and sub-steps. Pick a computer game and do the same (pseudocode into precode).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Figuring out how to break down the steps of a computer game was pretty challenging. We took the example given on the tic-tac-toe game and manipulated the main steps to fit with our game. Then, using Bing AI, we rephrased the psedocode.</p>
