			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with a partner to write functions that take user input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Had some small problems with the js file, specifically the output part. I had to remove one of the paranthesis after the quote so it would work. We also decided to omit the bonus task from this lab because we didn't really understand how to go about it. We felt we weren't quite yet ready to tackle it.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You can see the results as you click on this lab.</p>
