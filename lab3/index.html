			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject of Lab</h2>
					<p> Work with a partner to create a local file structure, add index.html files in order to upload them into the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that was faced was with links again. Kept forgetting to add in the main link of my website into the link for a certain lab. That led to problems with the file's existence, luckily I was able to resolve that real quick with the help of my partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My partner and I were able to follow through with the lab and make sense of what was asked for in the lab instructions. I think our websites came out the way they were supposed to and we were able to better understand how to create a file structure and locate our files more easily.</p>
