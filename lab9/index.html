                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I spent so long trying to figure out why my code wasn't working until I found out I was missing a pound sign in this part: $("#button-challenge").click(function(){. My partner and I were also struggling with Task X as we couldn't figure out how to make a button that would make each button's respective css changes, so, we ommitted that task from our lab.</p>
